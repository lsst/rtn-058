Guidelines on how to use the name Simonyi Survey Telescope in the different Rubin Observatory products

Usage of the Simonyi Name
=========================

In general we we try not to use abbreviations which loose the name we intend to honor. 
Hence we should avoid *ST*  and prefer Simonyi Telescope as a shorter name for the Simonyi Survey Telescope.

There are specific instances of use which we can consider:

 - Publications, Technotes, Presentations etc: we should use Simonyi Survey Telescope, no abbreviation like SST, no MT, no Main Telescope. If shortening is needed just use Simonyi, or the telescope
 - Slack Channels: #simonyi-nameofthe channel
 - Front-end such as LOVE, RubinTV ... Use Simonyi Telescope or Simonyi
 - Code and github: due to the complexity we will leave "MT" as a prefix. These names should be rename when used in front-end to the extend possible 


There may be other cases not falling neatly in these categories. Always consider using the name Simonyi instead of using an abbreviation.
