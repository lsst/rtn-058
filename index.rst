Abstract
========

Guidelines on how to use the name Simonyi in the different Rubin's Observatory products

Usage of the Simonyi Name
=========================
Explain we don't want abbreviations.... 

 - Publications, Technotes, Presentations etc: we should use Simonyi Telescope, no abreviation like SST, no MT, no Main Telescope. If shortening is needed just use Simonyi, or the telescope
 - Slack Channels: #simonyi-
 - Front-end such as LOVE, RubinTV ... Use Simonyi Telescope or Simonyi
 - Code and github: due to the complexity we will leave "MT" as a prefixe. These names should be rename when used in front-end to the extend possible
