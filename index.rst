Guidelines on how to use the name Simonyi Survey Telescope in the different Rubin's Observatory products

Usage of the Simonyi Name
=========================

In general we we try not to use abbreviations which loose the name we intend to honor. 
Hence we should avoid *ST*  and prefer Simonyi Telescope.

There are specific instances of use which we can consider:

 - Publications, Technotes, Presentations etc: we should use Simonyi Telescope, no abbreviation like SST, no MT, no Main Telescope. If shortening is needed just use Simonyi, or the telescope
 - Slack Channels: #simonyi-
 - Front-end such as LOVE, RubinTV ... Use Simonyi Telescope or Simonyi
 - Code and github: due to the complexity we will leave "MT" as a prefix. These names should be rename when used in front-end to the extend possible 


There may be other cases of course not falling neatly in these categories. 
Always consider not using an abbreviation and try to use at least the name Simonyi
